# Rich Client Application Sample

This was my last attempt to write a Java Swing GUI in 2008. It contains some (what I believed then) cool programming techniques.
It doesn't seem to work on modern Java runtime and I don't plan to maintain the project any more.

The original software was for collecting formal software requirements and 
estimate the programming effort with the Use Case Point method.
